# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Jonathan Fuller"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
doby_message = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
p doby_message

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
p students + 2


# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
p students - 2


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Jon"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 3

p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
#Explain

  #I chose to use the data types and values I did because the variable names were descriptive of what they required. First name is always going to be a string.
  #is_hungry is clearly a boolean/true or false situation. Either a person is hungry or not. Finally, the last variable name has number within the name so using a number makes sense.
  #You also can't really have half pets which is why I did not use a float value. I suppose you could argue if you and your partner shared a pet, that could be a half pet, but
  #I don't know anyone who would count it as half a pet.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Jerry"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 300

p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:

healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
total_snacks = healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks
p "The total number of snacks is #{total_snacks}"


#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
  #Yes, I did quite a number of times while completing it.
