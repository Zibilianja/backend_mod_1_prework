## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
### I Liked the Super Learner article and it definitely resonated with me well. I am happy to say I do most of these things already. I could always improve across the board, but I already am used to reading a lot since my master's program and continuing education in psychology. I have always seen learning as a process, I'm not sure how not to view it that way now. Especially in the field of tech, things change and grow so rapidly that learning will be a consistent area of focus. Even if new tech and languages weren't coming out, just learning how to dive deep into one is at some point, as much art as it is science, so learning how best to use the tools and how we best express ourselves once we learn how to properly use them is something that will never end. I have always seen the mark of truly learning something as being able to teach it to someone. I usually use this as a way to solidify my learning, or highlight the areas in which I am fuzzy and need to learn more about. Each time I try to teach someone, I learn something new and see it a little bit differently.

### Probably the thing I need the most practice with is just taking consistent and more frequent breaks. I am definitely someone who when I get focused on something, I go with it for a long time. Just since starting this program though, taking frequent and short breaks to step away seems to help my eyes, my motivation, my focus and my body from getting as tired as they usually do.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

### I would print the string by typing either print, puts or p and then typing the string, with quotations "Hello World!"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

### The hash or Octothorpe is used to denote a comment in a ruby file. In order to comment out a whole block of highlighted code use `cmd + /`.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

### An integer in Ruby is a whole number; with no decimal or fractions of numbers. A float is a number that accounts for decimals and fractions.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

 ```ruby
 animal = "zebra"
 ```

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

```ruby
p animal
```

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

###Interpolation is the use of variables in strings and the syntax required looks as follows:

```ruby
p "A #{animal}, is common to Africa and super stripey. Awesome."
```

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

### `gets` is used to get input from a user. The gets method requests the input from the user and the `.chomp` method eliminates a hidden `/n` or newline character from the resulting input.  

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

###The first common string method I use a lot is `.length`. This method tells you the length of any string including spaces. It can also be used on things like arrays or other iterable object. The second common string method that is really helpful is `.split()` which also takes arguments. The split method will split a string based around the argument passed in; `str.split(" ")` for example to separate a string into it's words and store them in an array. This allows for manipulating specific parts of strings and rearranging or pulling information from them to use seperately.
