# For the study drill explaining why 2010 is really 2010... I have no idea
# what this question is getting at. It is 2010 because it is 2010. It is
# displaying how many years have passed previously. If it were february of year 2,
# it would technically mean it has been 2 years and 2 months since the start of
# time as we know it lolol. Or since Jesus died, whatever it is on whatever planet,
# that whichever civilization determines the start of their calendars.
